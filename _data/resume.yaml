        details:
          - Woke is a tool that scans your source code to find usages of insensitive, non-inclusive language and provides you with alternative suggestions.
          - It can be run as a part of your CI suite, or as a pre-commit hook.
          - Woke helps by moving this burden off the individual to suggest or enforce inclusive language and onto an automated check.
